This object is responsible for deciding when to re-render the view and how to react to user input. With React, these view-controllers objects are called components. A component knows how to render its view and how to handle to the user’s interaction with it.</p>\n<p>The interesting thing is that React is figuring out by itself when to re-render a view and how to do this in the most efficient way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.mayflower.de/3937-Backbone-React.html\">Read the full post…</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"using-facebooks-react-with-requirejs\"><a href=\"#using-facebooks-react-with-requirejs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Using facebook’s React with require.js</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.xenji.com/\">Mario Mueller</a> wrote a menu component in React and was able to easily integrate it with require.js, EventEmitter2 and bower.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I recently stumbled upon facebook’s React library, which is a JavaScript library for building reusable frontend components. Even if this lib is only at version 0.3.x it behaves very stable, it is fast and is fun to code. I’m a big fan of require.js, so I tried to use React within the require.js eco system.

It’s also intended to be used along side many other popular libraries. For example, React works well with Backbone.js, amongst many others.</p>\n<p>React was born out of frustrations with the common pattern of writing two-way data bindings in complex MVC apps.
